Algorithm:

    1. The client begins by calculating a private/public keypair for key exchange.


Ignored TLS features:

    Early data.
        Early data can be sent if a session has previously been established with the server or when establishing a new
        session using an out-of-band PSK, and only when the server is known to support it. Additionally these functions
        can be used to send data from the server to the client when the client has not yet completed the authentication
        stage of the handshake.

        Early data has weaker security properties than other data sent over an SSL/TLS connection. In particular the
        data does not have forward secrecy. There are also additional considerations around replay attacks. For these
        reasons extreme care should be exercised when using early data. For specific details, consult the TLS 1.3
        specification.
